# Nigeria-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
Data Scientist Microdegree Capstone Project
# Project Overview
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered virus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.
In this project, I have employed data science & analytics skills to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights. 
# Steps
* The first thing I did was to collect data needed for analysis, using python's beautiful soup I was able to scrape data from NCDC covid-19 official website.
* I downloaded data from The Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering repository, they publish daily data on confirmed, death and recovered cases across different countries in their repository.
* I also made use of the Nigeria Community Vulnerability Index data, Real Domestic Gross Product Data, and the State Budget Data.
* After data collection, I cleaned the data, performed exploratory analysis on the data and I was able to derive the following insights:
