# Nigeria-COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Using-Python
Data Scientist Microdegree Capstone Project
# Project Overview
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus, and it has affected major parts of the world. Nigeria, a West-African country, has also been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic after recording its first case on 27th February 2020.

Nigeria is a country with 37 states - Federal Capital Territory included- and a fast-growing economic environment with about 200 million citizens. COVID-19 has affected several country activities as the country steadily progressed from its first case to shutting down major airports, state-wide lockdown, curfews, and reviving its economy.

In this project, you will employ data science & analytics skills to collect data, explore the data, perform analysis, create visualizations, and generate insights.
